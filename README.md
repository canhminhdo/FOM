# A tool for checking the word problem in free orthomodular lattices using model checking


## 1. Features
The tool is written in Maude 3.1 with the following features:

- formally specifying free orthomodular lattices
- formally specifying `FH theorem` by means of rewrite rules
- formally specifying `96 normal forms` by means of equations, which are generated automatically in our tool.

## 2. How to check the word problem

The formal specification of free orthomodular lattices and the `FH theorem` are used as default to check
the word problem for simple cases in which two formulae are short.

Besides the default mode, `96 normal forms` can be used to efficiently check the word problem for complicated cases if needed.

## 3. Papers
TBA
